Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that looks like a rectangle with two small cylinders placed on one side. First, create a sketch of a long rectangle, and then extrude it by a small amount. Next, draw two small circles, next to each other, placed on one end of the rectangle. Extrude these two circles by the same amount upwards, to depict two small cylinders placed on the rectangle.
