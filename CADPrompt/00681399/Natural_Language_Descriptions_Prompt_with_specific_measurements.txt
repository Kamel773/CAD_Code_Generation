Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a hollow pipe sticking out of a square block. Begin by creating a square with dimensions 0.990099 units in length and 0.415842 units in width, and extrude it to a height of 0.990099 units to form the square block. On the center of the top surface of this block, sketch a circle and perform a negative extrusion to create a circular hole with a diameter of 0.471867 units. Next, sketch an annulus on the same surface where the inner circle matches the diameter of the hole. The outer circle of the annulus should have a diameter of 0.517113 units, slightly larger than the inner circle. Finally, extrude this annulus upwards by 0.334158 units, almost matching the height of the square block, to form the hollow pipe. Adjust the entire assembly to be centered and slightly raised by translating it by (0, -0.207921, 0.025308) units.
