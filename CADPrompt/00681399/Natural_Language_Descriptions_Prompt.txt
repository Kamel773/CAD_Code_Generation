Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a hollow pipe sticking out of a square block. First create a sketch of a square and extrude it to get the square block. Now sketch a circle on the center of the squares surface and do a negative extrusion to get a circular hole in the square block. Then, sketch an annulus on the squares surface, such that the diameter of the inner circle is same as the hole in the square. The outer circle of the annulus should be slightly bigger than the inner circle. Now, extrude the annulus to almost the same amount as the square.
