Write Python code using CADQuery to create rectangular 3D object. First, create a sketch of a long rectangle, and then extrude it by a small amount. Next, draw two sketches of two small squares with rounded edges at two corners corresponding to the longer edge of the rectangle. Negatively extrude these square sketches, so as to create two square-shaped cutouts, with rounded edges, at two corners of the rectangular plate.
