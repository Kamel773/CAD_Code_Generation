Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular plate with dimensions 1.16102 units in length, 0.0729 units in width, and 1.5 units in height. Then, cut out two small symmetric holes with a diameter of 0.072899 units from the extruded rectangle. These holes should be parallel to each other and slightly offset from the rectangle's centerline. The holes should be positioned such that the left hole is 0.252909 units from the left edge and the right hole is 0.127776 units from the right edge of the rectangle. Both holes should be 0.595655 units from the top of the rectangle.
