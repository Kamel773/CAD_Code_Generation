Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a base diameter of 0.38527 units and a height of 0.256849 units. Then, connected to the center of the first cylinder's base, create a second cylinder with a diameter of 0.256849 units and a height of 0.493151 units, which is slightly smaller in diameter but larger in height compared to the first cylinder.
