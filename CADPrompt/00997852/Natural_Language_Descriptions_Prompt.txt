Write Python code using CADQuery to create tiered rectangular object. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle and then extrude it. Next, draw a sketch of a slightly smaller rectangle on top of the original rectangle, centered at the same point. Extrude this  second sketch upwards to give the appearance of a smaller rectangle placed on a larger rectangle.
