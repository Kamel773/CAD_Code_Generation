Write Python code using CADQuery to create a tiered rectangular object with specific dimensions. First, create a base rectangle with dimensions 1.5 units in length, 0.153061 units in width, and 0.918367 units in height. Then, on top of this base, centered at the same point, sketch a smaller rectangle with dimensions 1.43878 units in length and 0.841837 units in height. Extrude this second rectangle upwards by 0.229592 units to form a tiered appearance, resembling a smaller rectangle placed on a larger rectangle.
