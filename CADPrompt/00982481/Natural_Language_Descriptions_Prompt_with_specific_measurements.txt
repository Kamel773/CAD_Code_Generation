Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a height of 0.681818 units and a diameter of 0.681818 units. Then, extrude this cylinder. Next, create a circle with a diameter larger than the cylinder's, specifically 1.5 units, and place it near the top of the cylinder. Finally, extrude this circle to form another cylindrical segment with a height of 0.252273 units.
