Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square-shaped object with specific dimensions. First, draw a sketch of a square with a length and width of 1.5 units each, and extrude it to a height of 0.1125 units. Next, create a very small hole in the center of the square with a diameter of 0.15 units.
