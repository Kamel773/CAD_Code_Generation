Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D model consisting of two extruded rectangles, each with a length of 0.0625 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.0034 units. These rectangles should be connected at their edges, similar to the intersection between a wall and the floor, and positioned perpendicular to each other. The connection should occur along their elongated edge, forming a right angle between the two rectangles.
