 Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D model. This object is comprised of two marginally extruded rectangles that are connected at their edges like the intersection between the wall and the floor. Both rectangles have the same length, width, and height. The two extruded rectangles are perpendicular to each other and are connected by the elongated edge.
