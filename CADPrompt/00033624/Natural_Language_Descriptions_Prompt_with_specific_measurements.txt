Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long rectangle with a length of 0.21429 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.21429 units, and extrude it. Next, create two cylindrical holes each with a diameter of 0.05371 units, positioning them close to each end of the rectangle, ensuring there is a padding of 0.048699 units from the edges of the rectangle to the center of the holes.
