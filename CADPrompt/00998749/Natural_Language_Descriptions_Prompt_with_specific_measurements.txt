Write Python code using CADQuery to generate an open box. Begin by sketching a rectangle for the base of the box with a width of 0.440093 units and a height of 0.143395 units, ensuring the width is approximately twice the height. Extrude this rectangle to a depth of 0.143395 units to form the base. On the top surface of the base, sketch the four walls of the box using two concentric rectangles. The outer dimensions of the wall should match the base, and the inner dimensions should be slightly smaller, with a width of 0.382387 units and a length of 0.721321 units. Add a small rounded edge or chamfer to the inside corners of the wall with a radius of 0.017381 units. Finally, extrude this sketch upwards by 0.131228 units to create the walls of the open box. Adjust the final position of the box by translating it to the center with coordinates (length/2 - 0.030417, width/2 - 0.030417 + 0.001564, height/2).
