Write Python code using CADQuery to generate an open box. First generate the base of the box. In order to do that, sketch a rectangle whose width is twice its height and extrude it to a small depth. On top surface of the base, sketch the four walls of the box. You can use two concentric rectangles to represent the walls. Add a small chamfer/rounded edge for the inside corners of the wall. Now extrude this sketch upwards to get the final 3D object.
