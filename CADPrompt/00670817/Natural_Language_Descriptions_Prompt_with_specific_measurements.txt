Write Python code using CADQuery to create a circular object with a specific height and diameter. Begin by drawing a sketch of a circle with a diameter of 1.5 units and extrude it vertically by 0.113636 units to form a solid cylinder. Then, create a circular hole at the center of this cylinder. The hole should have a diameter of 0.738636 units and should extend through the entire height of the cylinder.
