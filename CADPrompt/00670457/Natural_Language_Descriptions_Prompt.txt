Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long rectangular object. First, create a sketch of a long rectangle. Next, draw a sketch of an isosceles trapezium, where the base of the trapezium is the same length as the shorter edge of the rectangle. connect this trapezium to the rectangle such that the base of the trapezium is attached to the shorter edge of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this object.
