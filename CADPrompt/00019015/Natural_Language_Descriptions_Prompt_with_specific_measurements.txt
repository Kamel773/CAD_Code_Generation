Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a height of 0.468766 units and a diameter of 1.31858 units. Then, create a rectangular prism with a length of 1.5 units, a width of 0.1875 units, and a height of 0.075 units. Position the rectangular prism horizontally on top of the cylinder, aligning it such that the center of the prism is directly above the center of the cylinder.
