Write Python code using CADQuery to create a simple desk with specific dimensions. First, create the surface of the table with a length of 1.5 units, a width of 0.32143 units, and a height of 0.064286 units. Then, create two legs for the table, each with a length of 0.064286 units, a width of 0.32143 units, and a height of 0.47129 units. Position one leg on the left side and the other on the right side of the table. Each leg should be approximately 1/3 of the table's length from the respective ends. Both legs should be extruded by the same amount as the table's height.
