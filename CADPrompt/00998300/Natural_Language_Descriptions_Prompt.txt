Write Python code using CADQuery to create a skewed, T-shaped 3D object. First, draw a sketch of a long vertical rectangle, and then extrude it by a small amount. Next, create a sketch of a smaller horizontal rectangle, with the same width as the original rectangle, and connect it to the first rectangle closer to the top of the object. The length of the rectangle should be around 1/4 of the original long rectangle. Finally, extrude the horizontal rectangle by the same amount as the vertical rectangle.
