Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a complex 3D object that resembles the profile of three connected mountains from the front view. The profile consists of three triangles: the center triangle is an equilateral triangle, and the two side triangles are acute-angled scalene triangles. The base of all three triangles is connected. Use the following specific parameters for the dimensions: the total length of the base is 0.676776 units, the peak of the first triangle is at 0.102138 units, the trough between the first and second triangle is at 0.059507 units, the peak of the second (center) triangle is at 0.135891 units, the trough between the second and third triangle is at 0.05773 units, and the peak of the third triangle is at 0.089704 units. The width of the base is 0.20312 units. After creating the profile, extrude it by 0.75 units to form the 3D object. Adjust the position of the object by translating it along the x-axis by -0.349931 units.
