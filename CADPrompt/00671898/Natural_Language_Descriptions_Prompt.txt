Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a complex 3D object that from the front resembles the profile of three mountains connected to each other. To create the profile draw three triangles next to each other. The base of all three triangles is connected to each other.  The center triangle is an equilateral triangle and the rectangles on the sides are acute-angled scalene triangles. Once you have the profile, extrude it to get the 3D object.
