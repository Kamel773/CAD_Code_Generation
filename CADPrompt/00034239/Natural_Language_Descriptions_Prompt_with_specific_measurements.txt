Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular prism with dimensions 1.5 units in length, 1.2 units in width, and 0.15 units in height. In the center of this rectangle, extrude a large circular hole with a diameter of 0.675 units. Additionally, position two smaller circular holes, each with a diameter of 0.1968 units, on the left and right sides of the large central hole. These smaller holes should be spaced 0.033 units from the edges of the rectangle.
