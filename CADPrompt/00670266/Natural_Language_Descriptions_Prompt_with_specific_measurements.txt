Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a tag. Begin by sketching a rectangle with dimensions 1.08869 units in length and 0.870954 units in width. Round the top edges of the rectangle with a fillet of 0.217746 units. Then, extrude this shape to a height of 0.108869 units. Centered just below the top edges, incorporate a small circular cutout with a diameter of 0.195965 units, positioned at an offset of 0.228625 units from the left edge.
