Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles an open pipe with specific dimensions. First, create a hollow cylinder with an outer diameter of 0.702675 units and a wall thickness of 0.049281 units. The cylinder should have a width of 0.75 units. Next, cut out a sector of this hollow cylinder by removing a box-shaped section that intersects with the cylinder. The box for cutting should have dimensions equal to the cylinder's diameter in both height and depth, and the same width as the cylinder. After the cut, you should be left with an object resembling a pipe missing a portion, similar to a pipe with a segment removed.
