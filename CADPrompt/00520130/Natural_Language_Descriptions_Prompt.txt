  Write Python code using CADQuery to create an object that resembles a grooved rectangle. Start by creating a large square in the X-Y plane and extruding it along the Z-axis. Next, create two sketches of smaller rectangles attached to the left and right of the square. These rectangles should have around 1/5th of the width of the square but should be the same length. Extrude both these rectangles to the same extent as the square, but in the opposite direction as the square such that they extrude out of the square.
