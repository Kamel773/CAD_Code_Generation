Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that looks like a rectangular block with a cylinder placed at the top. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle, and then extrude it. Next, draw a sketch of a circle at the center of the rectangle. The diameter of the circle should be approximately 1/4th of the length of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this circle upwards to create the image of a cylinder placed on top of a rectangle.
