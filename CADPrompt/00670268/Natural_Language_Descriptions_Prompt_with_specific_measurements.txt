Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical 3D object consisting of three cylinders. Start by creating a large cylinder with a height of 0.75 units and a diameter of 0.470339 units. Next, add a smaller cylinder protruding from one of the circular bases of the large cylinder, positioned slightly below the center. This second cylinder should have a height of 0.082627 units (which is 1/8th the height of the first cylinder) and a diameter of 0.152542 units (which is 1/4th the diameter of the first cylinder). Finally, create a third cylinder that is concentric with the second cylinder and protrudes outward. This third cylinder should have a height of 0.190678 units (twice the height of the second cylinder) and a diameter of 0.075981 units (half the diameter of the second cylinder). Adjust the positioning of the second and third cylinders using a padding of 0.247881 units from the edge of the first cylinder. Rotate the entire assembly by -90 degrees around the Y-axis to orient it as desired.
