Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical 3D object. First, create a large and long cylinder. Next, create a smaller cylinder, protruding from one of the circular bases of the cylinder and slightly below the center. This second cylinder should be 1/8th the height and 1/4th the diameter of the first. Finally, create a smaller concentric cylinder protruding outwards from the second cylinder. This third cylinder should be twice the height and 1/2 the diameter of the second cylinder.
