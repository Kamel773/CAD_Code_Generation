Write Python code using CADQuery to create a complex 3D object that resembles a shovel excavator. Begin by creating a sketch of an irregular rhombus using the following points: [(-0.215997, -0.071707), (0.283196/2 - 0.086266, -0.571139/2 + 0.128415), (0.283196/2 + 0.154673, 0.571139/2 - 0.103869), (0.283196/3 - 0.094331, 0.571139 - 0.45031)]. Extrude this sketch by a height of 0.493701 to form the main body of the excavator. Next, create a rectangular prism with dimensions 0.1323 by 0.78659 by 0.203642. Rotate this prism by -41.7 degrees around the Z-axis and translate it to the position (0.223543, -0.361526, 0.301748). Attach this rectangular prism to the center of one of the extruded edges on the rhombus to complete the model.
