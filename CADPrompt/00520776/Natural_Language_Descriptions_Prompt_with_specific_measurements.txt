Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a height of 0.381001 units and a diameter of 1.5 units. Inside this cylinder, create a vertical hole with a diameter of 0.060198 units that runs through the entire height of the cylinder. Start by drawing the outer circle and perform a positive extrusion to form the cylinder. Then, within the center of the outer circle, draw a smaller circle and negatively extrude it to create the hole through the cylinder.
