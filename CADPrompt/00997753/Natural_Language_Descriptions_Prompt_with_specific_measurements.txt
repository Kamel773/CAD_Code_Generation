Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a square baking mold with specific dimensions. Begin by creating a sketch of a square with rounded corners, where the square has a length and width of 1.5 units, and the corners are filleted with a radius of 0.157235 units. Extrude this sketch to a height of 0.655147 units. Next, on the top surface of the extruded object, sketch another square centered at the same point as the original square. This inner square should have a length and width of 1.44759 units, with corners filleted by a radius of 0.13103 units. Negatively extrude this inner square by 0.655147 units to create a hollow space within the original object, effectively forming the mold. Ensure that the final object is centered properly by translating it vertically by half the height of the extrusion.
