Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a square baking mold. First, draw a sketch of a square with rounded corners, and then extrude this sketch. Next, draw another sketch of a slightly smaller square with rounded edges, centered at the same point of the original square, on the surface of the first object. Negatively extrude this object by the same amount as the first extrusion to create a hole in the original object.
