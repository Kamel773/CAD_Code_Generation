Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object shaped like an irregular rhombus. Begin by creating a sketch of a square with each side measuring 0.32592 units. Next, sketch a right-angle triangle and attach it to the top of the square, ensuring that one of the shorter right-angle edges aligns with the square. The right-angle edges of the triangle should match the length of the square's sides. Finally, extrude this entire sketch by 0.023387 units to form the 3D object.
