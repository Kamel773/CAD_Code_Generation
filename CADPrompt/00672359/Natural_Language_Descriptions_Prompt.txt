Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object shaped like an irregular rhombus. First, create a sketch of a square. Next, create a sketch of a right-angle triangle and connect it to the top of the square, such that one of the shorter right-angle edges is connected to the square. The right-angle edges of the triangle should be the same size as the length of the square. Finally, extrude this entire sketch by a small amount.
