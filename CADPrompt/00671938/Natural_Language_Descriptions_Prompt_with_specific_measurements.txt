Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical object with a height of 0.75 units and a diameter of 0.419231 units. Begin by creating a sketch of two overlapping circles, each with a radius of half the diameter, and then extrude this sketch to the specified height. Position the first cylinder at coordinates (-0.09259, -0.022198, height/2) and the second cylinder at coordinates (0.082574, 0.01872, height/2).
