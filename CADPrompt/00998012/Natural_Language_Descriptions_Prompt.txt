Write Python code using CADQuery to create a complex, rectangular 3D object. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle, and then extrude it. Next, create a "L"-shaped sketch, on top the rectangle aligned with one of the corners of the rectangle. Extrude this sketch upwards to give the appearance of an L-shaped block on top of a rectangular block.
