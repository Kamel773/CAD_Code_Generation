Write Python code using CADQuery to create a complex, rectangular 3D object with specific dimensions. Start by creating a rectangle with a length of 0.9375 units, a width of 1.5 units, and a height of 0.375 units, and then extrude it to form the base block. Next, design an "L"-shaped sketch with one arm having a length of 0.234375 units and a height of 0.328125 units, and the other arm using the length of the base rectangle (0.9375 units). Position this "L"-shaped sketch on top of the rectangle, aligning it with one of the corners of the rectangle. Extrude this sketch upwards to create an L-shaped block on top of the rectangular block. Ensure the entire structure is centered by translating it vertically by half the height of the base block.
