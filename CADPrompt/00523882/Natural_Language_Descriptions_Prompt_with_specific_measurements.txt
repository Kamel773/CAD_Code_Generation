Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D model consisting of two right trapezoidal prisms. The first trapezoid should have a base length of 1.11043 units, a top length of 0.55953 units, a height of 0.625913 units, and be extruded to a width of 1.0011 units. The second trapezoid should have a base length of 1.27908 units, a top length of 0.619642 units, a height of 0.75 units, and be extruded to a width of 0.201835 units. Attach the second trapezoid to one side of the first trapezoid such that it is slightly larger and substantially less extruded than the first. The second trapezoid should be translated and rotated to align properly with the first trapezoid.
