Write Python code using CADQuery to create a star-shaped 3D object based on specific coordinates and dimensions. Begin by defining a sketch of a 5-sided star using the following points: (0, 0.07722659), (0.01489577, 0.03904715), (0.07129721, 0.03904715), (0.01778815, 0.01070181), (0.05105054, -0.0378901), (0, -0.0083879), (-0.0539429, -0.03470857), (-0.02183747, 0.006074), (-0.07071871, 0.02429601), (-0.01865585, 0.036444), and (0.0, 0.0772265). Close the polyline to complete the star shape, then extrude it by a height of 0.0634998086654784 units. Finally, scale the entire model by a factor of 9.711714302145034 to achieve the desired size.
