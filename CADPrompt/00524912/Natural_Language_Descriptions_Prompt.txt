  Write Python code using CADQuery to create two rectangles that are perpendicular to each other, resembling a door and its hinge, connected at one edge. Each rectangle should be extruded by different amounts, with the smaller rectangle being extruded almost twice as much as the first rectangle. Position the larger rectangle in the X-Y plane and the smaller rectangle in the Y-Z plane. The smaller rectangle should be centered at the same point as the larger one but should have approximately half the length and width.
