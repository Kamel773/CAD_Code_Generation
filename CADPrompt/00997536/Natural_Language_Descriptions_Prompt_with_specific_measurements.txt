Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical object with a diameter of 0.988192 units and a height of 0.75 units. Inside this cylinder, create an octagonal hole that has a diameter of 0.79436 units and extends through the entire height of the cylinder. The octagon should be a regular octagon with 8 sides. First, create a sketch of a circle with the specified diameter and extrude it to form the cylinder. Then, create a sketch of the octagon on the cylinder and negatively extrude it to create the octagonal hole within the cylinder. Ensure the octagon is properly centered and aligned within the cylinder.
