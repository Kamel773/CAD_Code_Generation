Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D model. Start by creating an extruded rectangle such that the length of the rectangle is approximately 5 times the width of the rectangle. Next, place a cylinder on one side of the rectangle very close to the edge. The radius of this cylinder should be approximately 1/3 of the width of the rectangular surface.
