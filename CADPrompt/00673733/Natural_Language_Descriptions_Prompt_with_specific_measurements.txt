Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D crescent-shaped object by first constructing a cylinder with a width of 0.75 units and a diameter of 0.249945 units. Then, create a second cylinder with the same dimensions but translated by 0.125404 units along the Z-axis. Subtract the second cylinder from the first to form a crescent shape, and finally, translate the resulting shape by half the width in the negative Y direction to center it.
