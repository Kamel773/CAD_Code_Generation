Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a height of 1.5 units and a diameter of 0.6 units. Then, cut a rectangular portion out of the top of the cylinder. The portion to be removed should have a length of approximately 0.235 units (about 1/4th the diameter of the cylinder), a width equal to the diameter of the cylinder (0.6 units), and a height of approximately 0.292 units (about 1/5th the height of the cylinder). Position the cut such that it starts from the top center of the cylinder and extends downwards.
