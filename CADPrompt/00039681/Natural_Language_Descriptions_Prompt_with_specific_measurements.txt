Write Python code using CADQuery to create a short pipe with two distinct hole diameters. The pipe should have a total height of 0.56371 units. The first half of the pipe should have a hole diameter of approximately 0.332143 units, and the second half should have a hole diameter of approximately 0.728571 units. Begin by sketching a cross-section representing the pipe with the smaller hole diameter and extrude it to a height of 0.242143 units. Then, at the end of this pipe, sketch the cross-section for the second half of the pipe with the larger hole diameter and extrude it to a height of 0.321568 units.
