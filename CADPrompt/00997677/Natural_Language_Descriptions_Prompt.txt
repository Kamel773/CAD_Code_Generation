Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles an inverted table. First, start by drawing a sketch of a rectangle, and then extrude this sketch by a small amount. Next, draw two sketches of two smaller rectangles, symetrically placed, at each end of the rectangle, and extrude these sketches to create rectangular columns protruding from the rectangular surface.
