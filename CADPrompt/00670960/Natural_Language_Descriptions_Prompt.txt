Write Python code using CADQuery to create a thin rectangular plate. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle where the length and width of the rectangle are close to each other. Next, draw a sketch of a slim, isosceles trapezium, where the length of the base is about 2/3rd of the length of the shorter side of the rectangle. The length of the angular sides are about 1/10th of the length of the base, with a base angle of approximately 45 degrees. Connect the trapezium to the rectangle, by attaching the base of the trapezium to the shorter edge of the rectangle. The trapezium should be placed on the edge of the rectangle such that the center of the trapezium is marginally to the right of the center of the shorter edge of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this entire sketch by a small amount.
