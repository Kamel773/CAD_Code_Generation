Write Python code using CADQuery to create a thin rectangular plate with dimensions approximately 0.75 units in length and 0.605769 units in width. Then, sketch a slim, isosceles trapezium where the length of the base is about 0.375 units, which is roughly 2/3rd of the shorter side of the rectangle. The angular sides of the trapezium should be about 0.028846 units in length, with a base angle of approximately 45 degrees. Attach the base of the trapezium to the shorter edge of the rectangle, positioning it such that the center of the trapezium is slightly to the right of the center of the shorter edge of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this entire sketch by a small amount, approximately 0.018035 units, to create a 3D object.
