Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D rectangular object, with a smaller rectangular slot within it. First, create a sketch of a rectangle and slightly extrude it. Next, create a sketch of a smaller rectangle, around half the size of the original sketch, at the center of the original sketch, and negatively extrude it. Negatively extrude it by an amount smaller than that of the original extrusion, to create a slot within the first rectangular 3D object.
