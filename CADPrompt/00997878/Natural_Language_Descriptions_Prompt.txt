Write Python code using CADQuery to create an object resembling a cinder block. First, sketch a rectangle, whose width is twice its height. Next, create two symmetrical rectangular holes in the first rectangle, their corners should be rounded. The holes are symmetrical about the verical centerline of the first rectangle. The width of each hole is about 5/12th the width of the first rectangle. The height of each hole is about 7/10th the height of the first rectangle. Extrude the sketch to a depth that is 1/4th the height of the first rectangle to get the 3D object.
