Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular object with specific dimensions. Start by creating a rectangle with a length of 0.00875 units, a width of 0.74801 units, and a height of 0.03125 units. Extrude this sketch to form the base object. Then, add a small rectangular cutout towards the bottom right side of the original rectangle. The cutout should have a width of 0.1625 units, a height of 0.0125 units, and should be positioned 0.01875 units from the left edge of the rectangle. This cutout should be approximately 1/4th the length of the original shape.
