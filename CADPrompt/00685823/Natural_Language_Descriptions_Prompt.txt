Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that looks like a square block with a circular cutout in one corner. First, draw a sketch of a square. Next, create a circular cutout from the top-right corner of the square. The sketch should look like one quadrant of a circle was taken out of the top-right corner of the square. Finally, extrude this sketch.
