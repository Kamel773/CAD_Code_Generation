Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a square block with a circular cutout in one corner. Begin by defining a square with dimensions of length 0.668421 units and width 0.334211 units. Then, create a circular cutout with a diameter of 0.2625 units (70% of 0.375 units) positioned at the top-right corner of the square. Ensure that the circle's quadrant appears as if it has been removed from the corner. Finally, extrude this sketch to a height of 0.668421 units to form the 3D object.
