Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object. Begin by drawing a sketch of a square with a length and width of 0.86802 units. Next, modify the sketch by attaching a semi-circle with a diameter of 0.86802 units to the top of the square, ensuring that the flat side of the semi-circle aligns perfectly with the top edge of the square. Finally, extrude this entire sketch to a height of 0.152284 units to form the 3D object.
