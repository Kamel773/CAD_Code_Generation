Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square with a length and width of 0.830095 units and extrude it to a height of 0.1703531 units. Without removing the top of the square, hollow out the inside of the shape by cutting a smaller square from it, with dimensions 0.676879 units by 0.676879 units and a depth of 0.105467 units. Centered at the bottom of the square, create a small circle with a diameter of 0.327945 units that is extruded to a height slightly less than the square, specifically 0.105467 units. Next, create four smaller circles each with a diameter of 0.25606 units and a height of 0.094448 units. These circles should be symmetrically positioned and slightly less extruded than the square. Position these circles on top of the square, with each circle located near a corner.
