 Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square and slightly extrude it. Then, without removing the top of the square, hollow out the inside of the shape. Centered at the bottom of the square, create a small circle that is extruded slightly less than the sqaure. Next, create four circles that are slightly smaller than the first circle, they should be symmetric and slightly less extruded than the sqaure. Position these circles on top of the sqaure, with each circle positioned near a corner of the square.
