Write Python code using CADQuery to a 3D model. Start by creating a marginally extruded rectangle such that the length of the rectangle is approximately 1.5 times its width. Now add a very small rectangluar rod pointing upwards from one of the corners of the rectangular surface. The height of the rod should be 3 times the length of the rectangle.
