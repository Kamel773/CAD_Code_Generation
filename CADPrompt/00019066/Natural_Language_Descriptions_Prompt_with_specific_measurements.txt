Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D model starting with a rectangle that is marginally extruded with a length of 0.345 units and a width of 0.0024 units, where the length is approximately 1.5 times the width. Then, add a very small rectangular rod at one corner of the rectangle, pointing upwards, with dimensions 0.00375 units by 0.75 units by 0.0075 units, where the height of the rod is 3 times the length of the rectangle.
