Write Python code using CADQuery for a 3D model that looks like a workbench. Start by creating an extruded rectangle with a length of approximately 1.05974 units and a width of about 0.362338 units. Extrude the rectangle to a depth equal to the width (0.362338 units) to form the upper part of the workbench. Make the inside of the rectangle hollow by cutting out a smaller rectangle from the center, with dimensions approximately 0.954546 units in length and 0.261039 units in width, and a depth of 0.314632 units.

Now add legs to the left and right side of this object. Each leg is a marginally extruded rectangle with dimensions 0.041039 units in length and 0.136796 units in width, and a height of 0.314632 units. Connect these legs to the bottom of the original surface, ensuring they are centered and perpendicular to the upper surface.

Finally, add a rod connecting the bottom of the left and right leg. The rod should be cylindrical with a diameter slightly less than the width of each leg (approximately 0.108522 units) and a length equal to the distance between the legs. This rod should be positioned to connect the legs near their bottom ends, enhancing the stability of the workbench model.
