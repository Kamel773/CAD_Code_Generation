Write Python code using CADQuery for a 3D model that looks like a workbench. Start by creating an extruded rectangle such that the length of the rectangle is approximately three times the width of the rectangle. Extrude the rectangle such that the depth of the surface is equal to the width. Finally make the inside of the rectangle hollow to complete the upper part of the workbench. Now add legs to the left and right side of this object. Each leg is a marginally extruded rectangle connected to the bottom of the original surface. The two legs are centered and perpendicular to the upper surface. The length of each leg should be approximately 3 times its width. After adding the legs, you need to add a rod connecting the bottom of the left and right leg. The diameter of this cylindrical rod should be marginally less than the width of each leg.
