Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a screw with a hexagonal head. First, draw a sketch of a regular hexagon and extrude it. Next, draw a smaller circle inside the hexagon, centered at the same point as the hexagon, and then extrude it outward to resemble a screw-bolt.
