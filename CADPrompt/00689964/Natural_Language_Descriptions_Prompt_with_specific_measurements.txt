Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a screw with a hexagonal head. Begin by drawing a sketch of a regular hexagon with a side length of 0.61859 units and extrude it by 0.214286 units. Next, draw a smaller circle inside the hexagon, centered at the same point as the hexagon, with a diameter of 0.321427 units. Then, extrude this circle outward by 0.75025 units to resemble the bolt of a screw.
