  Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object. Begin by sketching a square in the X-Y plane and extrude it along the Z-axis. Next, sketch another square at the top-right corner of the original square, approximately 1/5th its size, ensuring that their top-right corners touch. Negatively extrude this smaller square, creating an effect where it appears as if a chunk is missing from the original extruded object.
