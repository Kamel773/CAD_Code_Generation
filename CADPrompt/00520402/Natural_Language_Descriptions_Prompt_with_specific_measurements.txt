Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long, hollow cylinder with a height of 0.75 units, an outer diameter of 0.078575 units, and an inner diameter of 0.058318 units. After creating the cylinder, extrude it along its length. Then, cut a semi-circular shape with a diameter of 0.078654 units from the middle of the cylinder. Rotate and position the cut to achieve the desired shape and orientation.
