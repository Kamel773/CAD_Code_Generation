Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object resembling a trapezoid with a trapezoidal hole in it. First, create a sketch of a trapezoid shape, and then extrude this sketch. Next, create a trapezoidal hole in the first trapezoid, such that the size of the hole should be a little smaller than the size of the original trapezoid.
