Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D rectangular object with specific dimensions and two filleted corners. Begin by defining a rectangle with a length of 0.058594 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.216797 units. Then, modify two corners on one of the longer edges of the rectangle by adding rounded corners with a fillet radius calculated as the difference between the height and 0.1875 units. Finally, extrude this modified 2D shape to create the 3D object.
