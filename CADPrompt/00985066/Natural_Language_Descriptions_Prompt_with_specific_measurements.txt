Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object resembling an upside-down table. Begin by sketching a block "U"-shaped object, ensuring that the upright columns have a slightly larger width than the horizontal section. The dimensions for the upright columns should be 0.05 meters in length and 0.35 meters in width, while the horizontal section should have a length of 1.175 meters and a width of 0.35 meters. Next, extrude this sketch to create an object resembling an inverted table, with the columns having a height of 0.725 meters and the horizontal section having a height of 0.025 meters.
