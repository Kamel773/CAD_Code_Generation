Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object resembling an upside-down table with specific dimensions. First, create a "U"-shaped sketch where the upright columns are twice the width (0.416667 units) of the horizontal section (0.083333 units). Next, extrude this sketch to a height of 0.475 units to form an object resembling an inverted table. Finally, create a small circular hole with a diameter of 0.1375 units at the center of the horizontal surface of the table.
