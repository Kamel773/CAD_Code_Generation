Write Python code using CADQuery to create a short rectangular pipe with a length of 0.1875 units, a width of 0.1875 units, and an extrusion height of 0.75 units. The pipe should have an internal padding of 0.014063 units on all sides, creating a thinner wall around the perimeter. The pipe should be rotated 90 degrees around the x-axis.
