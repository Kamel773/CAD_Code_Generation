Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular plate with specific dimensions and a rectangular hole within it. Begin by creating a rectangle with dimensions 0.231564 units in length, 0.028954 units in width, and extrude it to a height of 0.926255 units. Next, sketch a smaller rectangle inside the original rectangle, with dimensions approximately 1/4th the size of the first rectangle (0.12897 units in length and 0.479215 units in height). Position this smaller rectangle at the bottom of the original object, ensuring there is a small space of 0.005463 units between the bottom of the new rectangle and the bottom of the original rectangle. Finally, negatively extrude this smaller rectangle to create a rectangular hole in the original object. Adjust the position of the entire part by translating it by (-0.050509, -0.014477, 0.286873) units to achieve the desired placement.
