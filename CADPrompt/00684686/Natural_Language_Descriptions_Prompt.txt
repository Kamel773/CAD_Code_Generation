Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular plate with a rectangular hole within it. First, create a sketch of a rectangle and slightly extrude it. Next, create a smaller sketch of a rectangle inside the original rectangle, it should be around 1/4th the size of the first rectangle. Place it at the bottom of the original object, such that there is a small space between the bottom of the new rectangle and the bottom of the original rectangle. Finally, negatively extrude this rectangle to create a rectangular hole in the original object.
