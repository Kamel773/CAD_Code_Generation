Write Python code using CADQuery to create an object that resembles a corner brace plate connector. Start by sketching a rectangle with a length of 1.49973 units and a width of 0.16071 units, and add semi-circular ends to it. Then extrude this shape by 0.05357 units. Next, create two holes with a diameter of 0.080357 units, positioning each hole near the center of one of the semi-circular ends.
