Write Python code using CADQuery to create an irregular, 3D pentagonal prism. Begin by sketching an irregular pentagon defined by the following points: the top vertex at (0, top_height), the middle left vertex at (-mid_length/2 + mid_shift, 0), the bottom left vertex at (-bottom_length/2 + bottom_shift, -bottom_height), the bottom right vertex at (bottom_length/2 + bottom_shift, -bottom_height), and the middle right vertex at (mid_length/2 + mid_shift, 0). The bottom edge of the pentagon, which is the shortest edge, should be defined by the distance between the bottom left and bottom right vertices. After creating the pentagon, extrude this sketch by an amount almost two times the height of the pentagon to form the 3D pentagonal prism. Use the following specific parameters for your design: extrude length of 0.75, mid_length of 0.234841, bottom_length of 0.11742, mid_height of 0.280088, top_height of 0.204477, and bottom_height of 0.279461, with shifts mid_shift of 0.004644 and bottom_shift of 0.002349.
