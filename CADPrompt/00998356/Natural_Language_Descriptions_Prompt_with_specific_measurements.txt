Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a triangular 3D object with specific dimensions and features. Begin by sketching an isosceles triangle with a base length of approximately 1.19143 units and a height from the base to the top vertex of approximately 0.85714 units. Round the edges of the two bottom corners of the triangle using a radius of 0.094286 units for the inner circle and an outer diameter of 0.214604 units for the rounding. Cut off the top corner of the triangle with a straight line to create a flat edge near the top, positioned at a height of approximately 0.85714 units from the base. Near each corner of the triangle, sketch a small circular hole with a diameter of 0.094286 units. Extrude this sketch to a height of 0.085714 units to form the 3D object. Additionally, cut a rectangular section from the top flat edge and a cylindrical hole near the base center to refine the shape. Rotate and translate the final object to align and position it as required.
