Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a triangular 3D object with holes. To generate the object first sketch an isoceles triangle and rounded the edges of the two bottom corners. Cut off the top corner with a straight line to get a straight edge near the top of the triangle. Near to each corner sketch a very small circular hole. Now extrude this sketch to get the 3D object.
