Write Python code using CADQuery to create a tiered rectangular object with a circular hole through the center of the object. First, create a sketch of a rectangle and then extrude it. Next, create a sketch of another rectangle with a smaller width but the same length and place it at one end of the rectangle. Extrude this rectangle outwards, by the same amount, to give the appearance of a smaller rectangular block placed on top of a larger rectangular block, resembling a staircase. Finally, create a circular hole, which passes through both rectangles, at the center of the upper rectangular block.
