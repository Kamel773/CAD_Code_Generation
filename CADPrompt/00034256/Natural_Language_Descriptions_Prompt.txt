  Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object resembling a U-shaped clamping bracket. Begin by creating a U-shaped sketch and then fill in the empty space of  the U-shape. Then, close the open part of the U-shape with a rectangle wider than the U's width. Extrude this sketch to form a 3D object that looks like a U-shaped clamping bracket.
