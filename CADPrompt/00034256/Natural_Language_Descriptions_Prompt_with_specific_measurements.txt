Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object resembling a U-shaped clamping bracket. Begin by creating a U-shaped sketch with a base length of 0.75 units and a width of 0.3 units. Fill in the empty space of the U-shape, ensuring the walls of the U are aligned with the base dimensions. Then, close the open part of the U-shape with a rectangle that is wider than the U's width by 0.45 units. Extrude this sketch to form a 3D object with a height of 0.15 units for the base and additional elements extending up to 0.45 units, resembling a U-shaped clamping bracket.
