Write Python code using CADQuery to create a complex 3D object. First, create a sketch of a rectangle. Next, attach a semi-hexagonal section to the rectangle such that the larger edge is connected to the longer edge of the rectangle. The length of the semi-hexagon should be 2/3rd of the length of the rectangle, wherein the semi-hexagon starts at one end of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this sketch.
