Write Python code using CADQuery to create a complex 3D object. Begin by creating a sketch of a rectangle with dimensions 0.399631 units in width and 0.091591 units in height. Next, attach a semi-hexagonal section to the longer edge of the rectangle. The semi-hexagonal section should start at one end of the rectangle and extend 2/3rd of the rectangle's length, with a maximum width of 0.188808 units. Finally, extrude this combined sketch by 0.133054 units to form the 3D object.
