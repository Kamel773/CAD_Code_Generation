Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D cylindrical object with specific dimensions and multiple holes. First, create a large cylinder with a height of 0.375 units and a diameter of 1.5 units. Next, create a central hole through the cylinder with a diameter of 0.1875 units. Finally, add three smaller holes, each with a diameter of 0.1125 units, arranged in a triangular formation around the central hole. These smaller holes should be offset from the center by 0.24375 units towards the outer edge of the cylinder.
