Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D plate shaped like a pentagon. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle. Augment, the sketch of the rectangle by connecting an isosceles triangle to the top of the rectangle, such that the larger flat side is connected to the longer edge of the rectangle and has the same length as the longer edge of the rectangle. Next, cutout the bottom two corners of the sketch such that the sketch looks like small triangles were cutout from the bottom-left and bottom-right corners respectively. Finally,  extrude the entire sketch by a small amount.
