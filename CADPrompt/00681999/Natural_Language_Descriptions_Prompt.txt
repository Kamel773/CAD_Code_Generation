Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object. Sketch a large rectangle whose height is about 2/3rd its width. Now create a square cutout from the rectangle, it should be about 1/3rd the rectangles size. This sqaure cutout is placed such that its top edge is coincident with the center of the top edge of the first rectangle. This square cutout extends downward to about the center of the rectangle. Now extrude the remaining shape to get the final 3D object.
