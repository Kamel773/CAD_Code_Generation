Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square-shaped 3D object. First, create a sketch of a square and marginally extrude it. Next, create a sketch of a slightly smaller square, centered at the same position as the original square, and extrude it by the same amount. The final object should look like two squares placed on top of each other such that the square on top is slightly smaller.
