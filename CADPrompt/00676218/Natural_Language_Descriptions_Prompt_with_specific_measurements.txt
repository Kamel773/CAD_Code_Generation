Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square-shaped 3D object with specific dimensions. First, create a sketch of a square with dimensions 1.5 units by 1.5 units and extrude it to a height of 0.023438 units. Next, create a sketch of a slightly smaller square, centered at the same position as the original square, with dimensions reduced by a margin of 0.05625 units on each side, and extrude it by the same height of 0.023438 units. The final object should look like two squares placed on top of each other, with the square on top being slightly smaller.
