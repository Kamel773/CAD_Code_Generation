Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a rectangular 3D object with specific dimensions and cutouts. Begin by creating a base rectangle with a length of 1.48234 units, a width of 0.413495 units, and a height of 0.039009 units. On the left and right edges of this rectangle, incorporate two rectangular cutouts. The right cutout should have a length of 0.147465 units, a width of 0.183609 units, and be positioned 0.115044 units from the right edge. The left cutout should be three times longer than the right cutout, with a length of 0.320737 units, a width of 0.187173 units, and positioned 0.101171 units from the left edge. Finally, extrude the sketch to the specified height to create the final 3D object. Adjust the entire object slightly in the X-axis by 0.008832 units and center it vertically by translating it half the height upwards.
