Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical ring with a height of 0.00656 units and an outer diameter of 1.5 units. The ring should have a central hole with a diameter calculated by subtracting 0.203459 units twice from the outer diameter. After creating the ring, extrude it along the x-axis and position it so that the center of the ring aligns with the midpoint of its height.
