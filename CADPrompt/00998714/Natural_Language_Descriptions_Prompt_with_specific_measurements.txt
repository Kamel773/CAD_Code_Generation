Write Python code using CADQuery to create a triangular 3D object with specific dimensions. First, draw a sketch of an equilateral triangle with each side measuring 0.929516 units, pointing downwards. Next, cut out a semicircle from the bottom corner of the triangle, where the diameter of this semicircular cutout should be approximately 2/3rd of the length of each side of the triangle, which is about 0.619677 units. Finally, extrude this sketch to a height of 0.3 units to create a 3D object.
