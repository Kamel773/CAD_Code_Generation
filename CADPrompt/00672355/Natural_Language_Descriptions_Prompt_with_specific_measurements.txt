Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model of a cylindrical 3D object. Begin by drawing a circle with a diameter of 0.95 units and extrude it vertically to form a cylinder with a height of 0.475 units. On the top surface of this cylinder, center a thin rectangle with a width of approximately 0.76 units (which is about 4/5th the diameter of the circle) and a length of 0.7 units. The height of the rectangle should be small, about 0.0275 units (which is about 1/10th the width of the rectangle). Finally, extrude this rectangle vertically to about half the height of the cylinder, approximately 0.2375 units, to complete the 3D model.
