Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model of a cylindrical 3D object. To make the object first draw a circle and extrude it to get a cylinder. On the top surface of the cylinder draw a thin rectangle that is centered on the center of the circle. The width of rectangle is about 4/5th the diameter of the circle. The height of rectangle is small, about 1/10th the width of rectangle. Now, extrude this rectangle to about half the height of the cylinder to get the final 3D object.
