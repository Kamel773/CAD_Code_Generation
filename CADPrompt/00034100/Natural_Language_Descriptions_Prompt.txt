Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangle and extrude it. Next, create a circle positioned above the midpoint of the rectangle and negatively extrude it to create a hole in the rectangular block. Then, create a thin slit going through the rectangular block from the top of the circular hole to the shorter edge of the rectangle. This slit should look like it has been cut with a wire-cutter.
