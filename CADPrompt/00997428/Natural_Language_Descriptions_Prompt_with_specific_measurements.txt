Write Python code using CADQuery to create a hollow cylindrical object resembling a bucket. Begin by sketching a circle with a diameter of 0.503822 units and extrude it vertically to a height of 0.75 units to form the outer cylinder. Then, sketch a smaller circle inside the first one with a diameter of 0.426316 units and negatively extrude it downwards by 0.710526 units to create a hollow space inside the cylinder, ensuring the hollow does not extend through the entire cylinder. Finally, create a horizontal cylindrical rod with a diameter of 0.05921 units and a length of 0.631579 units. Position this rod such that it passes through each side of the cylinder, placing it towards the top with a margin of 0.049342 units from the top edge of the cylinder. The rod should be slightly longer than the diameter of the cylinder to ensure it extends from both sides.
