Write Python code using CADQuery to create a large hollow cylinder with a height of 0.75 units and an outer diameter of 0.533654 units. The cylinder should have a wall thickness of 0.017308 units. Extrude this cylinder along the Z-axis. Then, create a circle at the bottom of the cylinder to close it off. Next, create a tiny hollow circle in the middle of the bottom circle with a diameter of 0.090144 units and a depth of 0.034616 units.
