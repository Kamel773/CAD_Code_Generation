Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular 3D object with a semi-circular cutout. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle, and then extrude it. Next, draw a sketch of a semi-circle on the rectangle, such that the flat edge of the semi-circle is on the longer side of the rectangle. Finally, negatively extrude this semi-circle to create a cutout in the original rectangular object.
