Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular 3D object with specific dimensions. Start by creating a rectangle with a length of 1.5 units, a width of 0.40625 units, and extrude it to a height of 0.023438 units. Next, create three small cylindrical holes, each with a diameter of 0.046875 units. Position these holes in a triangular formation within the rectangle: one hole centered along the width near one end, and the other two holes symmetrically placed near the opposite end, with specific padding from the edges. Adjust the positions using the following padding values: side padding of 0.048699 units, width padding of 0.039062 units, left padding of 0.242188 units, and right padding of 0.242228 units. Finally, translate the entire part so that the base of the rectangle aligns with the origin in the Z-axis by moving it up by half the height of the rectangle.
