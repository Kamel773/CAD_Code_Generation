Write Python code using CADQuery to create a short, cylindrical object with a circular hole through the center. First, create a circle and then extrude it to form a cylinder. Next, draw a smaller circle centered at the same point, with a radius of about half of that of the first circle, and then negatively extrude it to form a hole. Finally. create a small square connected to the outer edge of the cylinder, and negatively extrude it, by the same amount, to create a channel along the height of the cylinder.
