Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long rectangular prism with a length of 1.5 units, a width of 0.52105 units, and a height of 0.15789 units. Then, cut out a semi-circle shape from the length of the rectangular prism, where the semi-circle has a diameter of approximately 1.701232 units (calculated as half the length plus twice 0.067116 units). The semi-circle should be extruded through the height of the prism and positioned such that it cuts through the center of one of the longer faces of the prism.
