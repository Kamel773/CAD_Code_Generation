Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a diameter of 1.5 units and an extrusion height of 0.1 units. Then, create four smaller cylindrical holes, each with a diameter of 0.1124 units, positioned symmetrically around the center of the main cylinder. These holes should be placed in a square layout, each hole offset from the center by a distance calculated as half the main cylinder's radius minus half the hole's diameter minus a padding of 0.041187 units. Rotate the entire configuration by 45 degrees to align the square of holes diagonally relative to the main cylinder's axis. Finally, rotate the part 90 degrees around the Y-axis and adjust its position to center it properly in the 3D space.
