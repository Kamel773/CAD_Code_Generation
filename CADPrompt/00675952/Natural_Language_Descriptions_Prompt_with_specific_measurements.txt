Write Python code using CADQuery to create a trapezoidal prism with specific dimensions. The trapezoid should have a base length of 1.49593 units, a top length of 0.910569 units, and a height of 0.382114 units. The trapezoid should be centered and shifted slightly along the x-axis by 0.026423 units. The resulting trapezoidal face should then be extruded to a width of 0.589754 units to form the prism.
