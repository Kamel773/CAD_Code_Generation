Write Python code using CADQuery to create a square with dimensions 1.3125 inches by 1.3125 inches and extrude it to a height of 0.0625 inches. Then, create four tiny circular holes, each with a diameter of 0.05 inches, positioning each one near a corner of the square. Next, create a hollow cylinder with an outer diameter of 1 inch and an inner diameter of 0.9375 inches, and extrude it to a height of 0.6875 inches. Position this cylinder so that it intersects the square in the middle and extends through it. The entire assembly should be translated slightly in the Z-axis by approximately 0.03125 inches.
