Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object that resembles a two step pedestal. First, you can create a side profile of the pedestal. You can do it by creating two rectangles joined to each other. First draw a big rectangle that will represent the base level. On top of this draw a smaller rectangle that represents the second step. Make sure the two rectangles are connected. Extrude this profile to get a 3D model of the two step pedestal.
