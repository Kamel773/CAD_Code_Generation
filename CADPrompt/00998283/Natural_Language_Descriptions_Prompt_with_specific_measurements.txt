Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long 3D trapezoidal prism with specific dimensions. Start by creating a sketch of an isosceles trapezium with a base length of 0.3 units, a top length of 0.225 units, and a height of 0.1875 units. Then, extrude this trapezium by 0.75 units to form the prism. Ensure the trapezium is centered and correctly oriented before extrusion.
