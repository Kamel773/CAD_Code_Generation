Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a diameter of 1.5 units and extrude it to a height of 0.06 units. Next, create a second cylinder with a diameter of 0.75 units in the middle of the first one, and extrude it to a height of 0.375 units. Then, cut off a small rectangle with a length of 0.21 units and a width of 0.45 units from the first cylinder, positioning it on the right side of the second cylinder, ensuring the rectangle is placed with a padding of 0.12 units from the edge of the first cylinder.
