Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long L-shaped bracket with specific dimensions. The bracket should have a main body with a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.015 units, and a height of 0.3 units. Additionally, there should be a top extension on the bracket with a width of 0.15 units and a height equal to the main body's width. Start by drawing a sketch of an L shape and then extrude this sketch to form the 3D object.
