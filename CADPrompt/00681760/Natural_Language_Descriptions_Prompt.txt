Write Python code using CADQuery to create a tiered 3D object, that resembles an inverted, trapezoidal prism placed on a rectangular block. First, draw a sketch of a rectangle. Next, draw a sketch of an isosceles trapezium, such that the longer side has the same length as the larger side of the rectangle. Connect this to the rectangular sketch by attaching the smaller, parallel edge of the trapezium to one of the larger edges of the rectangle. Finally, extrude this entire sketch by a large amount.
