Write Python code using CADQuery to create a hexagon with a side length of 1.15342 units and extrude it to a height of 0.249723 units. Then, on top of this hexagon, create a second smaller hexagon with a side length of 0.865066 units and extrude it to a height of 0.199778 units. Next, on top of the second hexagon, create a third even smaller hexagon with a side length of 0.576711 units and extrude it to a height of 0.099889 units. Finally, on top of the third hexagon, create a triangle with an effective radius of approximately 0.228054 units (calculated from the given triangle side length formula) and extrude it to a height of 0.079911 units. Ensure that no vertices of any shape align with the vertices of the shapes below by rotating each subsequent shape slightly differently.
