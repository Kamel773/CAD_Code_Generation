Write Python code using CADQuery to create a "U"-shaped object. First, create a rectangular sketch and then extrude it. Next, create another sketch of a rectangle such that the larger side is approximately 2/3rd of the size of the larger side in the original rectangle. Place this rectangle in the middle of the rectangle, connected to the top edge. Negatively extrude this smaller rectangle to create a cutout in the original rectangular block.
