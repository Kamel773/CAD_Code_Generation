Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a box end wrench. Begin by creating a sketch of a long rectangle with a length of 0.848067 units and a width of 0.197368 units. Replace the ends of the rectangle with two circles, ensuring that each circle has a larger diameter than the width of the rectangle. The circle on one end should have a diameter of 0.157782 units, and the circle on the other end should have a diameter of 0.196626 units. Extrude this sketch to form the basic shape of the wrench. Finally, create two circular holes within the two circular ends of this object; the hole in the smaller circle should have a diameter of 0.094737 units, and the hole in the larger circle should also have a diameter of 0.094737 units.
