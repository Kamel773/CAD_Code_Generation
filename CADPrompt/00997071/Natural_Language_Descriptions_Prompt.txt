Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular object that looks like a puzzle piece with a circular hole in it. First, create a sketch of a rectangle. Next, sketch two smaller rectangles. Each should be on either side of the first shape, connected to the center of its longer edge. Now extrude this whole shape. Finally, create a large circular hole at the center of the object.
