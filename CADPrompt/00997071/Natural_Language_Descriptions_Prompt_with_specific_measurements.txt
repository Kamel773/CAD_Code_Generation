Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangular object that resembles a puzzle piece with a circular hole in its center. Begin by sketching a main rectangle with dimensions 0.636792 units in length and 0.56638 units in width. Then, add two smaller rectangles, each with dimensions 0.636792 + 0.113207*2 units in length and 0.141509 units in width, positioned symmetrically on either side of the main rectangle, connected at the center of its longer edges. Extrude this combined shape to a height of 0.099057 units. Finally, cut a circular hole with a diameter of 0.318396 units through the center of the extruded object.
