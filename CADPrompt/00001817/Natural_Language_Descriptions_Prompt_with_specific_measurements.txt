Write Python code using CADQuery to create a table with specific dimensions. First, create a rectangular table top with a length of 1.20302 units, a width of 0.55872 units, and a height of 0.020134 units. Then, create four legs, each being a long extruded square with a length and width of 0.060403 units and a height of 0.75 units. Position these legs at each corner of the table top, ensuring they are linked to the bottom of the table top.
