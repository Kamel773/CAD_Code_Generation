  Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a tag. To create the 3D object, sketch a filled U-shaped figure. This sketch can be made by adding a semi-circle at the bottom of a rectangle. Extrude this sketch. Next, at the respective center of the semi-circle, make a circular cutout that has the same height and 1/4th size diameter as the semi-circle.
