Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object that resembles a tag. To create the 3D object, sketch a filled U-shaped figure by adding a semi-circle with a diameter of 0.75 units at the bottom of a rectangle with a length of 0.75 units and a width of 0.75 units. Extrude this sketch to a height of 0.16071 units. Next, at the center of the semi-circle, make a circular cutout with the same height of 0.16071 units and a diameter that is 1/4th the size of the semi-circle's diameter, which is 0.267857 units.
