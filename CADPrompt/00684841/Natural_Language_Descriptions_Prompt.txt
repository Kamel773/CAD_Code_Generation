Write Python code using CADQuery to create a curved, 3D object. First, create a sketch of a minor sector of a circle and then extrude it. Next, create a sketch of another sector, centered at the same point, but with a marginally smaller radius and place it on the original object. Negatively extrude this sketch to cutout the inside of the original object to leave a small sector from a hollow-cylinder.
