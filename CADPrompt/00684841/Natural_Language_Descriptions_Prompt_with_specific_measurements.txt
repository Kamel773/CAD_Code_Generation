Write Python code using CADQuery to create a curved, 3D object. Begin by creating a sketch of a minor sector of a circle with a radius of 0.18 units on the XZ plane, and then extrude it along a path defined by a rectangle with dimensions 0.0075 by 0.750037 units, centered at (-0.00375, 0) on the XY plane. Next, create a sketch of another sector, centered at the same point, but with a marginally smaller radius of 0.18 units, and place it on the original object. Use this second sketch to negatively extrude through the original object to cut out the inside, leaving a small sector from a hollow cylinder. Adjust the final object's position by translating it to (0.180047, -0.375015, 0) and rotating it 180 degrees around the Z-axis.
