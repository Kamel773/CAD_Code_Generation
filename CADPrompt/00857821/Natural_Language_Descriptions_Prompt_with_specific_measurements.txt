Write Python code using CADQuery to create a heart-shaped object with a diameter of 0.374906 units and a height of 0.1875 units. The heart shape is formed by combining a circle and a custom polygon, then extruding the resulting shape. The circle is centered at (diameter/2, diameter*2 - 0.187124) with a radius of (diameter/2). The polygon is defined by points at (0,0), (0,diameter), and ((diameter*.7) + 0.01883 - 0.0001, diameter). The final 3D model is created by extruding the combined 2D shape and then translating it to center it vertically.
