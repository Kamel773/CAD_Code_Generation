Write Python code using CADQuery to create a pipe with a thin flange at one end. The pipe should be hollow, constructed using two extrusions: a positive extrusion for the inner circle with a diameter of approximately 0.70248 inches and a height of 0.75 inches, and a negative extrusion for the outer circle with a diameter of 0.825 inches and a height of 0.01125 inches. The outer circle should form a very thin flange at the base of the pipe.
