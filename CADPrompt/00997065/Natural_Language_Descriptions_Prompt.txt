Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object. To create the object first create its top profile and then extrude it. To sketch the top profile, sketch a square shape. On the left and right edges of the square sketch two small rectangles whose center is along the horizontal centerline going from left to right of the square. The height of the rectangles is twice their width. Make sure the sketch is closed and can be extrude. Now extrude the sketch to a small depth to get the final object.
