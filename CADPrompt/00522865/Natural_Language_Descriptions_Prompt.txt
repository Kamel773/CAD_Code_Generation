  Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangle and slightly extrude it. Then, in the center of that rectangle, create a rectangular shaped hollow that is half the size of the original shape. Next, on top of the first shape and at its center, create a minimally extruded rectangle. This shape should be 3/4th the size and 1/4th the extrusion of the original shape. Finally, create two very tiny rectangles and extrude them. Positioning them on either side of the second shapes first line of symmetry and slightly below its second line of symmetry.
