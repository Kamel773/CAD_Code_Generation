Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object that resembles a rectangular plate with a slotted groove. Begin by sketching a rectangle with a length of 1.5 units and a width of approximately 1.37143 units, where the width is about 2/3rd of the length. Extrude this rectangle to a height of 0.078171 units to form the rectangular plate. Then, on the center of the front profile of this plate, sketch another smaller rectangle with a length of 0.085714 units and a height that spans the entire height of the plate (0.078171 units). Subtractively extrude this smaller rectangle through the centerline of the larger rectangle to create a slotted groove, resulting in the final 3D object. Ensure the groove is positioned such that it starts from 0.685714 units from the left edge of the plate.
