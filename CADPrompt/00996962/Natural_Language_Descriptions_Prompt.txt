Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object that resembles a rectangular plate with a slotted groove. To generate the object first sketch a rectangle whose width is about 2/3rd its height. Extrude the rectangle to get a rectangular plate. Now on the center of the front profile of the rectangular plate, sketch a small rectangle running from the bottom to the top. Now subtractively extrude this small rectangle to create a slotted groove through the centerline of the rectangle to get the final object.
