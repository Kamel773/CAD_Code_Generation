Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object. To create the object first create its side profile and then extrude it. To sketch the side profile, first sketch a thin rectangle. The height of the rectangle is minimal (about 1/20th the width). On top of this thin rectangle sketch a square whose side is about half the width of the rectangle. The square is placed such that its bottom right corner is coincident with the top right corner of the rectangle. The bottom left corner of the square is coincident with the vertical line going through the center of the rectangle. On top of this square draw another square that is just smaller than the first square. Place this square also in a way that the bottom right corener of the second square is coincident with the top right corner of the first square. Make sure that the sketch forms a closed shape that can be extruded. Extrude this front profile to a depth that is about 20 times the width of the rectangle in the sketch to get the final object.
