Write Python code using CADQuery to generate a CAD model for a 3D object that resembles a thermometer. To create the object first sketch a circle. At the edge of the circle, sketch a long thin rectangle whose height is about 7 times its width. Make sure that the bottom of the rectangle touches the circle, but isn't fully merged. Near the top edge of the rectangle create a small cicrular hole. Make sure the sketch forms a closed area that can be extruded. Extrude the sketch to a small depth to get the 3d object.
