Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder. Next, create a second cylinder with the same height but smaller diameter. The second cylinder should connect to the center of the first cylinders base. Then, create a third cylinder with a shorter height and larger diameter relative to the first two cylinders. This third cylinder should connect to the center of the second cylinders other base. Finally, create a small circular cut-out extending the length of all three cylinders relative to their centers.
