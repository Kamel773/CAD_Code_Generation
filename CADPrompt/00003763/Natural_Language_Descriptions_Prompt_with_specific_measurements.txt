Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylinder with a height of 0.248985 units and a diameter of 0.192096 units. Next, create a second cylinder with the same height of 0.220645 units but a smaller diameter of 0.13302 units. This second cylinder should connect to the center of the first cylinder's base. Then, create a third cylinder with a shorter height of 0.070261 units and a larger diameter of 0.250707 units relative to the first two cylinders. This third cylinder should connect to the center of the second cylinder's other base. Finally, create a small circular cut-out with a height extending the total length of all three cylinders (0.539891 units) and a diameter of 0.098666 units, centered through the entire assembly.
