Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long, rectangular object with specific dimensions. First, sketch a long rectangle with a length of 0.647727 units, a width of 0.051136 units, and extrude it to a height of 0.025568 units. Next, sketch two small squares, each with the same width as the rectangle (0.051136 units), a length of 1/16 of the rectangle's length (approximately 0.040483 units), and extrude them to 1/3 of the rectangle's height (approximately 0.008523 units). Position these squares symmetrically on the center of the rectangle's shorter edges.
