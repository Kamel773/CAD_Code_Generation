Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long, rectangular object. First, sketch a long rectangle and extrude it by a small amount. Next, sketch two small squares with the same width, 1/16 length, and 1/3 the extrusion as the rectangle. Connect these squares to the center of the rectangles shorter edge.
