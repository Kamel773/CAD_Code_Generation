Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object based on the following specifications: Start by creating a sketch of a rectangle with a length of 0.875 units and a width of 0.15 units. Round two corners of the same long edge of the rectangle with a fillet radius of 0.25 units. Then, extrude this sketch to a height of 1.5 units. Finally, create two small, evenly-spaced circular holes on the same side as the rounded corners. Each of these holes should have a diameter of 0.3 units and be positioned close to one of the rounded corners. Adjust the placement of the holes by adding a padding of approximately -0.639071 units to the length and height dimensions of the rectangle during the hole creation process.
