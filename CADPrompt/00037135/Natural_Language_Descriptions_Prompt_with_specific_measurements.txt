Write Python code using CADQuery to create a bench by sketching a shape resembling the letter 'h' on the X-Y axis using specific points. The points for the polyline are [(-0.05430806, 0.05735744), (-0.05430806, -0.05851911), (-0.04704762, -0.05851911), (-0.0383351, -0.00217813), (0.00232334, -0.00217813), (0.0116167, -0.06200412), (0.01742505, -0.06200412), (0.01452087, 0.01030982), (-0.02875133, 0.01030982), (-0.0450147, 0.05735744), (-0.05430806, 0.05735744)]. After creating the polyline, close it to form a loop and extrude this sketch along the Z-axis by 0.1016 meters to form the basic shape of the bench. Finally, scale the entire object by a factor of 7.38186180173805, and rotate it first by -90 degrees around the X-axis, and then by -90 degrees around the Z-axis to position it correctly.
