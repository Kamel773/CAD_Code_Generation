Write Python code using CADQuery to create a hexagon with 6 sides and a side length of 1.47802 units, extrude it to a height of 0.5 units, and then create a cylinder with a diameter of 1.2 units and a height of 0.25 units. Place the cylinder on top of the hexagon and ensure that the cylinder is extruded to half the height of the hexagon.
