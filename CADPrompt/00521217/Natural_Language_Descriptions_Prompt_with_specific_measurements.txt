Write Python code using CADQuery to create a large cylinder with a diameter of 0.059646 units and a height of 0.750036 units. Then, extrude this cylinder. Next, create a smaller, longer cylinder on the bottom of the first cylinder with a diameter that is half of the first cylinder (approximately 0.029823 units) and a length that is five times the length of the first cylinder (approximately 3.75018 units).
