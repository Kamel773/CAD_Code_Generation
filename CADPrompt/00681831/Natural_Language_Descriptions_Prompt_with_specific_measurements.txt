Write Python code using CADQuery to create a cylindrical 3D object with a diameter of 0.955953 units and a width of 0.295686 units. Begin by drawing a circle with the specified diameter. Next, cut out a small isosceles trapezium from the top of the circle, ensuring the trapezium has a base length of 0.163062 units, a top length equal to the base length, and a height calculated as the difference between the cylinder's diameter and an offset of 0.698688 units. The sketch should resemble a small trapezoidal sector removed from the circle. Finally, extrude this entire sketch to create the cylindrical object. Adjust the position of the cylinder by translating it by (0, width/2, -0.272116) to center it appropriately.
