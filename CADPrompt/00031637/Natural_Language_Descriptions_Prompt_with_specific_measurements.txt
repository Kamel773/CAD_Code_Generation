Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long rectangular prism with dimensions of length 1.05964 units, width 0.56859 units, and height 0.26362 units. Then, cut out a smaller rectangular prism from the right side of the original shape. This cut-out should have the same width as the original, a length that is 1/4th of the original length (approximately 0.206758 units), and a height that is 3/4th of the original height (approximately 0.186082 units).
