Write Python code using CADQuery to create a long and thin cylinder with a diameter of 0.02262 units and a height of 0.75 units. Next, create three circular holes within the cylinder, each with a diameter of 0.015476 units. Position one hole near the top of the cylinder, and the other two near the bottom. The hole near the bottom should be slightly closer to the cylinder's center, with specific placements at 0.004167 units, 0.123228 units, and 0.06399 units from the respective edges of the cylinder. Rotate and translate the final assembly for proper orientation.
