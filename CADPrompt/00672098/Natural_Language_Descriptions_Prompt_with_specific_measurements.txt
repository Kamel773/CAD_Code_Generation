Write Python code using CADQuery to create a U-shaped object by starting with a rectangular base of dimensions 0.337772 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.021792 units in height. Then, subtract a smaller rectangle from the center of the base, leaving a margin of 0.01816 units on the sides and top, to form the "U" shape. Finally, extrude this "U" shaped sketch by a small amount to create the 3D object.
