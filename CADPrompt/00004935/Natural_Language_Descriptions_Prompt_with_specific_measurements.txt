Write Python code using CADQuery to create a 3D object consisting of two concentric cylindrical shapes. First, create a larger base cylinder with a diameter of 1.5 units and a height of 0.114796 units by extruding a circle. Then, create a smaller top cylinder with a diameter of 1.17857 units and a height of 0.306123 units. Position the smaller cylinder on top of the larger one by translating it vertically by the height of the base cylinder.
