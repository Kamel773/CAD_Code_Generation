 Write Python code using CADQuery to create a rectangle and then slightly extrude it. Next, create another rectangle on top of the first one with slightly smaller widths on the left and right sides only. Finally, create a vertically opposite isosceles trapezoid on top of the second rectangle, with a slightly longer width than the second rectangle.
